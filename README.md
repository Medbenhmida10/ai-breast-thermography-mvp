# Ai-breast-thermography-mvp

This repository hosts the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** for an 
AI-assisted thermography solution in breast cancer screening.

##  Purpose
- Explore thermographic imaging as a **non-contact, portable screening tool**.
- Develop a **deep learning CAD (Computer-Aided Diagnosis)** pipeline.
- Evaluate feasibility and accuracy of models on public datasets.

##  Project Structure
- `notebooks/` — Colab & Jupyter experiments (training, visualization).
- `data/` — Placeholder for synthetic/test data .
- `results/` — Experimental results, PDFs, charts.
- `docs/` — Documentation, literature reviews, and related resources.

## ⚙️ Features
- Preprocessing: Temperature normalization, breast ROI segmentation, grayscaling, resizing ...
- Model: ResNet18 with Grad-CAM for explainability.
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity.
- Charts & visual storytelling for technical presentations.

##  Issues & Projects
We use **GitHub Issues** for bug tracking & tasks, 
and **Projects** for roadmap visualization.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This MVP is for **research & prototyping only**.  
No real patient-sensitive data is stored here.
